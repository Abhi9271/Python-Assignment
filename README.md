# Python-Assignment
Merge Sort: 
  User can enter an unsorted list from the terminal 
  after specifying the number of items and it will be sorted using 
  Merge Sort Algorithm
  
Depth First Search:
  Takes a graph in the form of an adjacency list (predefined)
  but can be changed. Two  types of graphs are provided for testing the algorithm
  The program applies the DFS algorithm using recursion and outputs the DFS order, 
  the parent node of every node, and the traversal time in the form of lists.
  Colors are assigned to mark whether a node is visited(B), currently being visited(G), and 
  not visited (w)
